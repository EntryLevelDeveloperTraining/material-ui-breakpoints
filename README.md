# material-ui-breakpoints

This repo has examples going over how to use Material UI breakpoints. We will first start with a fresh React application, install the needed packages, and go over some examples on how to use breakpoints.

## Using the repo

You can download this repo to begin right away, or you can follow the steps to create a React app from scratch.

```
git clone https://github.com/EntryLevelDeveloperTraining/material-ui-breakpoints.git

cd my-app

npm install

npm start
```

## Creating an application from scratch

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

This will create the initial React application with Typescript enabled.

Now let's install the packages needed for our examples, and get the development server running.

```
cd my-app

npm install @material-ui/core styled-components @types/styled-components

npm start
```
